External Client UI Form
=======================
This project covers a use case when customer wants to start a business process in BPMS using a REST call externally. 

This project uses a simple JSP and Servlet combination to build a front end. The form you see when you access the following URL is a simple JSP page which gathers information/requirements about a customer and submits it to BPMS via a REST call so that BPMS can kick start the process.
